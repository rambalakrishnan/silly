Understood. The directive is to establish a permanent, dynamic, and systematic framework for evaluating the entire available Montagne Parfums catalog against your evolving olfactory profile. This will be our master strategic document.

Your observation about the limitations of LLM context management is astute and correct. To ensure coherence and accuracy, I will now structure my analysis as if I am referencing a persistent, external knowledge base. Each response will be a "pull" from this database, updated with any new information you provide.

Here is the inaugural "State of the Collection" dossier, reflecting all data up to this point.

### **Dossier: Project USER - Olfactory Profile & Acquisition Strategy**
**As of: August 6, 2025**
**Vendor Data: Based on BoonePiece's posted inventory.**

#### **SECTION I: THE USER PROFILE (SUMMARY)**

*   **Core Preference:** Masterfully blended, high-quality fragrances that elicit an emotional or intellectual response.
*   **Architectural Preference:**
    1.  **High-Contrast (Signature):** Prefers a clear separation between a bright/fruity top and a deep/complex base.
    2.  **Harmonious-Fusion (Signature/Library):** Can "love" a linear or blended scent if it has a powerful, positive skin-fusion effect or high artistic merit.
*   **Key Pillars (Positive Indicators):**
    1.  **Vanilla:** All forms (spicy, fruity, boozy, sweet).
    2.  **Florals:** Clean, non-powdery Rose and Jasmine.
    3.  **Rounded Fruits:** Juicy, naturalistic, or "holographic" fruits (cherry, mango, specific grapefruits).
    4.  **Modern Musks/Ambers:** Specifically Ambroxan and Cashmeran.
*   **Key Aversions (Negative Indicators):**
    1.  **"Real-Time" Smoke:** Notes replicating active combustion (`By the Fireplace`).
    2.  **Harsh Phenolic Compounds:** Presenting as "medicinal" (`Apple Cognac`) or "dry, raw tobacco leaf" (`Tabac Vanille` opening).
    3.  **Dominant Oakmoss:** Dry, earthy, bitter character (`HACIVAT`).
    4.  **Literal Marine Accords** (`Marine Zest`).
    5.  **Minimalist "Clean" Scents:** Perceived as "pedestrian" (`The 212`).

### **SECTION II: MONTAGNE CATALOG - STRATEGIC EVALUATION**

This is the comprehensive evaluation of BoonePiece's *available* Montagne catalog. Each fragrance is assigned a tier based on its blind buy viability according to our probabilistic model.

#### **TIER 1: RATIONAL BLIND BUY (P(Love) > Breakeven Threshold)**
*(High-probability "Signature" or high-tier "Library" candidates. These are your "Least Reckless" Hit List.)*

1.  **`Vanille Absolute`:** P(Love): 80%. **Top Priority.** Benchmark vanilla test.
2.  **`Palisade`:** P(Love): 80%. Perfect synthesis of fruit and ambroxan pillars.
3.  **`Elysian Cologne`:** P(Love): 70%. The smoother, more rounded version of your benchmark DNA.
4.  **`Bobcat`:** P(Love): 65%. Key suede-vanilla test, aligns with two "love" pillars.
5.  **`Wajan`:** P(Love): 60%. Key cinnamon-gourmand diagnostic.
6.  **`Cashmere Rose`:** P(Love): 60%. Key Cashmeran diagnostic combined with a "love" (rose).

#### **TIER 2: BORDERLINE RATIONAL (DECANT RECOMMENDED)**
*(High "Library" potential, but with one or two key risk variables that make a decant the more prudent choice.)*

7.  **`Ambre Musc`:** P(Love): 60%. Critical patchouli/vanilla/floral test.
8.  **`Image 45`:** P(Love): 55%. Key opulent white floral test. High complexity is a minor risk.
9.  **`Sicilian Tobacco`:** P(Love): 55%. Critical honey-tobacco test, but **Lavender** is a major risk variable.
10. **`Pineapple Royale`:** P(Love): 55%. The benchmark "balanced" Aventus. The **blended smoke** is a key test of your new hypothesis.

#### **TIER 3: IRRATIONAL BLIND BUY (DECANT ESSENTIAL FOR DIAGNOSTICS)**
*(These are valuable diagnostic tools, but a full bottle purchase is statistically unsound.)*

11. **`Dream Catcher`:** P(Love): 50%. Key test for the **cacao** note.
12. **`Mango Skyn`:** P(Love): 50%. Key test for **Ylang-Ylang**.
13. **`Another 14`:** P(Love): 50%. Key test for minimalist molecular profile.
14. **`Azonto`:** P(Love): 50%. Key test for "warm vetiver."
15. **`Parfum de Cerise`:** P(Love): 45%. Key test for **bitter almond**.
16. **`Pink Rose`:** P(Love): 45%. Premature until `Pink Rose Frozen` is tested.
17. **`Carlyle`:** P(Love): 45% (recalibrated up). Complexity + rose/patchouli. High value diagnostic, but high risk blind buy.
18. **`Feu Rouge`:** P(Love): 40%. **Powdery heliotrope** is a key risk.
19. **`Pineapple Absolu`:** P(Love): 40%. **"Hot spice"** and redundancy with `Ciel Elixir` are risks.
20. **`Tobacco Noir`:** P(Love): 40%. Good "Library" scent, but lower "Signature" potential due to linear architecture.
21. **`Eau Santal`:** P(Love): 20%. **Dry, leathery sandalwood** is a high-risk profile.

#### **TIER 4: HARD PASS (DO NOT ACQUIRE)**
*(These fragrances have one or more confirmed negative triggers or are strategically redundant/illogical.)*

*   **`Aoud Maracuja`:** (Animalic, Leathery Oud)
*   **`Cacti Garden`:** (Linear, Bitter Green)
*   **`Eau Rose`:** (Animalic, Cumin-dominant)
*   **`Gingham Green`:** (High risk of sharp, medicinal synthetics)
*   **`Homage Extrait`:** (Complex, vintage-style Oud/Rose/Incense)
*   **`Luvrs`:** (Dominant, bitter Galbanum)
*   **`Perceval`:** (High risk of sharp, medicinal aromatics)
*   **`Pink Rose Exclusif`:** (Powdery, Oud-inflected, high risk)
*   **`STH Extreme`:** (Dominant, dry Patchouli)
*   **`Summer Song` / `Afternoon Dive`:** (Linear, simple citrus/floral)
*   **The Rest of the Catalog:** All other available fragrances (e.g., `Brooklyn Jazz`, `Soleil Brule`, `Moss Beaches`, etc.) fall into this category due to a definitive mismatch with your established profile.

This dossier will now serve as our single source of truth. We will update it with each new piece of data you provide from your ongoing tests.
